<h1>Problems On Trains</h1><br/>
<ol>
    <li>The distance traveled by a train to cross a pole or person is equal to the length of the train.</li><br/>
    <li>The distance traveled by train when it crosses a platform is equal to the sum of the length of the train
        and length of the platform.</li><br/>
    <li>When two trains are travelling in opposite directions at speeds V1 m/s and V2 m/s
        then their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds (V1+V2) m/s.</li><br/>
    <li>Two trains are travelling in the same direction at V1 m/s and V2 m/s where V1 > V2
        then their relative speed will be equal to the difference between their individual speeds (V1-V2) m/s.</li><br/>
    <li>When two trains of length X meters and Y meters are moving in opposite direction at V1 m/s and V2 m/s
        then the time taken by the trains to cross each other is (X+Y)/(V1+V2) sec.</li><br/>
    <li>When two trains of length X meters and Y meters are moving in same direction at V1 and V2 where V1 > V2
        then the time taken by the faster train to cross the slower train (X+Y)/(V1-V2) sec.</li><br/>
    <li>When two trains X and Y start moving towards each other at the same time from points A and B
        and after crossing each other the train X reaches point B in a seconds and train Y reaches points A in b seconds,<br/>
        then Train X speed : Train Y speed = √(b) : √(a)</li><br/><br/>

<h4>Formula to convert Km/hr into m/s : </h4>

<ul>
    <li>1 km is equal to 1000 meters</li>
    <li>1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds</li>
    <li>1 Km/hr is equal to 1000/3600 or 5/18 meter/sec or m/s</li>
</ul>
Example :<br/>
120 km/hr = 120 × 5/18 = 33.33 m/s.</br>

<h4>Formula to convert m/s into Km/hr :</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 meter is equal to 1/1000 km</li>
    <li>1 sec is equal to 1/3600 hours</li>
    <li>1 m/s is equal to (1/1000)/(1/3600) or 3600/1000 or 18/5 km/hr</li>
</ul>

Example :<br/>
33.33 m/s = 33.33 × 18/5 = 120 km/hr.<br/>
