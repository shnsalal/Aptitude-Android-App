<h1>HCF And LCM</h1><br/>
<p><b>Factors : </b>The numbers are said to be factors of a given number when they exactly divide that number<br/>
Example : All the Factors of 60.<br/>
    60 = 1 × 60 <br/>
    60 = 2 × 30 <br/>
    60 = 3 × 20 <br/>
    60 = 4 × 15 <br/>
    60 = 5 × 12 <br/>
    60 = 6 × 10 <br/>
    <b>  Factors :</b> 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60 </p><br/>

<p><b>Greatest Common Factor : </b>Greatest common factor (also called the greatest common divisor) is the largest number that can divide all the numbers evenly.<br/>
    Example : Greatest common factor of 12 and 8.<br/>
    factor of 12 = 1,2,3,4,6,12<br/>
    factor of 8 = 1,2,4,8<br/>
    <b> The Greatest common factor is</b> 4 </p><br/>

<p><b>Multiple : </b>Multiple of any number is a number which can be divided exactly by that number.<br/>
    Thus, 45 is the multiple of 1,3,5,9,15 and 45.</p><br/>

<p><b>Common multiple : </b> A common multiple of two or more numbers is a number which is exactly divisible by each of them.<br/>
    Thus, 6, 12 and 24 is a common multiple of 2,3, and 6.</p><br/>

<p><b>Prime factorization : </b>Prime factorization is finding the factors of a number that are all prime that multiply to create the original number.<br/>
Example : <br/>
    Prime factorization of 24 <br/>
    24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3<br/><br/>
    Prime factorization of 16
    16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2</p><br/>

<h2>Highest Common Factor (H.C.F)</h2>
<p><b>H.C.F : </b>The H.C.F of two or more than two numbers is the greatest number which divides each of them without any remainder.<br/></p>

<h4>Method of Finding H.C.F </h4>

<p><b>Method I : </b>Prime factorization<br/>
Express each one of the given numbers as the product of prime factors. The product of least powers of common prime factors gives H.C.f<br/>
Example I : <br/>
    Find the H.C.F of 6 And 8 by Prime factorization Method?<br/>
    Solution : <br/>
    6 = 2 × 3<br/>
    8 = 2 × 2 × 2<br/>
    Common factor of 6 and 8 = 2<br/>
    Thus,H.C.F of 6 and 8 = 2<br/><br/>

    Example II : <br/>
    Find the H.C.F of 24, 36 And 72 by Prime factorization Method?<br/>
    Solution : <br/>
    24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3<br/>
    36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3<br/>
    72 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3
    H.C.F of 24, 36, and 72 = product of common factors with least power = 2 × 2 × 3<br/>
    Thus,H.C.F of 24, 36, and 72 = 12 <br/><br/>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Method II : </b>Successive Division Method<br/>
    Divide the larger number by the smaller one. Now, divide the divisor by the remainder. Repeat the
    process of dividing the preceding number by the remainder last obtained till zero is obtained as remainder.
    The last divisor is the required H.C.F.<br/>
    Example I : <br/>
    Find the H.C.F of 8 14 by Successive Division method?<br/><br/>

</p>

<h2>Least Common Multiple (L.C.M)</h2>
<p><b>L.C.M : </b>L.C.M. of two or more given numbers is the samllest number which is divisible by all the given numbers.<br/></p>

    <h4>Method of Finding L.C.M </h4>

<p><b>Method I : </b>Prime factorization<br/>
    Express each one of the given numbers as the product of prime factors. The product of least powers of common prime factors gives L.C.M<br/>
    Example I : <br/>
    Find the L.C.M of 8 And 14 by Prime factorization Method?<br/>
    Solution : <br/>
    8 = 2 × 2 × 2<br/>
    14 = 2 × 7<br/>
    L.C.M of 8 and 14 = product of all the prime factors of each of the given number with greatest power of common
    prime factors = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 = 56.<br/><br/>
</p>

    <b>Method II : </b>Division Method<br/>
    Divide the larger number by the smaller one. Now, divide the divisor by the remainder. Repeat the
    process of dividing the preceding number by the remainder last obtained till zero is obtained as remainder.
    The last divisor is the required H.C.F.<br/>
    Example I : <br/>
Find the L.C.M of 8 And 14 by using Division Method?<br/><br/>
<center><img border="1" src="file:///android_res/drawable/lcm.png" alt="nothing" width="180" height="250" /></center><br/><br/>
L.C.M of the given number = product of the divisiors and the remaining numbers = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 = 56.<br/>
