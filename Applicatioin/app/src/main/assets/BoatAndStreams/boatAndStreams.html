<h1>Boat And Stream</h1><br/>

<b>Still water :</b> The water of a river or any other water body which is not flowing is known as still water.<br/><br/>
<b>Stream :</b> It is the flowing water of a river which is moving at a certain speed.<br/><br/>
<b>Upstream :</b> The boat or a swimmer moving against the stream is known as moving upstream i.e. against the flow of water.<br/><br/>
<b>Downstream :</b> The boat or a swimmer moving along the stream is known as moving downstream i.e. along the flow of water.<br/><br/>

<h1>Concepts</h1><br/>

1. If the speed of the boat or swimmer is X km/hr and the speed of the stream is Y km/hr,<br/>
<ul>
<li>The speed of the boat or swimmer in the direction of the stream is known as speed downstream.<br/>
    <center> <b>Speed downstream= (X+Y) km/hr</b></center></li><br/>

<li>The speed of the boat or swimmer against the stream is known as speed upstream.<br/>
    <center><b>Speed upstream= (X-Y) km/hr</b></center></li>
</ul>

2. Speed of man or boat in still water is given by;<br/>
<center><b>S<sub>b</sub> = 1/2(  S<sub>d</sub> + S<sub>u</sub>)</b></center><br/>
where,<br/>
    S<sub>b</sub> = Speed of boat in still water<br/>
    S<sub>d</sub> = Speed downstream<br/>
    S<sub>u</sub> = Speed upstream<br/><br/>

3. Speed of the stream is given by;<br/>
<center><b>S<sub>s</sub>=1/2( S<sub>d</sub> - S<sub>u</sub>)</b></center><br/><br/>

4. A man can row at a speed of X km/hr in still water. If the speed of the stream is Y km/hr and the man rows the same distance up and down the stream, his average speed for the entire journey is given by;<br/>

<center><b>S<sub>a</sub>= S<sub>u</sub> * S<sub>d</sub>/ S<sub>b</sub><br/>
    S<sub>a</sub>= (x-y)*(x+y)/x km/hr</b></center><br/>
where,<br/>
S<sub>a</sub> = Average speed<br/>
S<sub>b</sub> = Speed of boat in still water<br/>
S<sub>d</sub> = Speed downstream<br/>
S<sub>u</sub> = Speed upstream<br/><br/>

5) A man can row a boat in still water at X km/hr. If the stream is flowing at Y km/hr it takes him t hours more to row upstream than to row downstream to cover the same distance. The distance is given by;<br/>
<center><b> Distance = (x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup>)*t/2y</b></center><br/><br/>

6) A man can swim in still water at X km/hr. If the stream is flowing at Y km/hr it takes him t hours to reach a place and return back to the starting point. The distance between the place and the starting point is given by;<br/>
<center><b>Distance = (x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup>)t/2x</b></center><br/><br/>

7) A boat or swimmer covers a certain distance downstream in t1 hours and returns the same distance upstream in t2 hours. If the speed of the stream is Y km/hr, the speed of  boat or man in still water is given by;<br/>
<center><b>S<sub>b</sub>= Y(t2+t1/t2-t1)km/hr</b></center><br/><br/>

8) A boat or swimmer takes K times as long to move upstream as to move downstream to cover a certain distance. If the speed of the stream is Y km/hr, speed of the boat or man in still water is given by;<br/>
<center><b> S<sub>b</sub> = Y(k+1/k-1)km/hr</b></center><br/><br/>
