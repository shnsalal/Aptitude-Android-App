<h1>Percentage</h1><br/>

1. By a certain percent we mean that many hundredths Thus, x percent means x hundredths, written as x%.
<ul>
    <li><b>To express x% as a fraction :</b><br/>
        x% = x/100<br/>
        Thus, 20% =20/100 = 1/5,<br/>
        48% = 48/100 = 12/25, etc.</li><br/>

    <li><b>To express a/b as a percent :</b><br/>
        a/b = (a/b*100)%<br/>
        Thus, 1/4 = (1/4*100)% = 25%,<br/>
        0.6 = 6/10 = 3/5 = (3/5*100)% = 60%, etc.</li>
</ul><br/>

2. <ul>
   <li> If the price of a commodity increases by R%, then the reduction in consumption so as not to increase the expenditure is [(R/(100+R))*100]%.</li><br/>

    <li>If the price of a commodity decreases by R%, then the increase in consumption so as not to decrease the expenditure is [(R/(100-R))*100]%</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

3. <b>Results on Population :</b> Let the population of a town P now and suppose it increases at the rate of R% per annum, then :<br/>
<ol>
    <li>Population after n years = P(1+R/100)<sup>n</sup>.</li><br/>

    <li>population n years ago = p/(1+R/100)<sup>n</sup>.</li>
</ol><br/><br/>

4. <b>Results on Depreciation :</b> Let the present value of a maachine be P. Suppose it depreciates at the rate of R% per annum, Then :<br/>
<ol>
    <li>Value of the machine after n years = P(1-R/100)<sup>n</sup>.</li>

    <li>Value of the machine n years ago = p/(1-R/100)<sup>n</sup>.</li>
</ol><br/>

5. <ul>
<li>If A is R% more than B, then B is less than A by
    [(R/(100+R))*100]%.</li><br/>

<li>If A is R% less than B, then B is more than A by
    [(R/(100-R))*100]%.</li>
</ul>
