<h1>Ratio And Propotion</h1><br/>

1. <b>Ratio :</b> The ratio of two quantities a and b in the same units, is the fraction a/b and we write it as a:b.<br/><br/>
    In the ratio a:b, we call a as the first term or antecodent and b, the second term or connsequent.<br/><br/>
    Example : The ratio 5:9 represents 5/9 with antecedent= 5, consequent= 9.<br/><br/>

<b>Rule :</b> The multiplication or division of each term of a ratio by the same non-zero number does not affect the ratio.<br/><br/>
    Example :<br/> 4 : 5 = 8 : 10 = 12 : 15 etc. Also, 4:6=2:3.<br/><br/><br/>

2. <b>PROPORTION :</b> The equality of two ratos is called proportion.<br/><br/>
    If a:b=c:d, we write, a:b::c:d and we say that a,b,c,d are in proportion.<br/><br/>
    Here a and d are called extermes, while b and c are called mean terms,<br/><br/>
    Product of means = product of extremes.<br/>
    Thus, a:b::c:d = (b*c)=(a*d).<br/><br/><br/>

3.
<ol>
    <li><b>Fourth Proportional :</b> If a:b = c:d, then d is called the fourth proportional to a,b,c.</li><br/>
    <li><b>(2) Third Proportional :</b> If a:b = b:c, then c is called the third proportional to a and b.</li><br/>
    <li><b>Mean Proportional :</b> Mean proportional between a and b is root ab.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>

4.
<ol>
    <li><b>Comparison of Ratios :</b><br/>
        We say that (a : b) > (c : d) = a/b > c/d.</li><br/>

    <li><b>Compounded Ratios :</b><br/>
        The compounded ratio of the ratios (a:b), (c:d),(e:f) is (ace:bdf).</li>
</ol><br/>

5.
    <ol>
        <li>Duplicate ratio of (a:b) is (a square:b square).</li>
        <li>Sub-duplicate ratio of (a:b) is (root a: root b).</li>
        <li>Triplicate ratio of (a:b) is (a cube : b cube).</li>
        <li>Sub-triplicate ratio of (a:b) is (a:b).</li>
        <li>if a/b = c/d, then a+b/a-b = c+d/c-d.(componendo and dividendo)</li>
    </ol><br/><br/>
6. <b>Variation :</b>
    <ol>
        <li>We say that x is directly proportional to y, if x = ky for some constant k and we write, x proportional y.</li><br/>
        <li>We say that x is inversely proportional to y, if xy = k for some constant k and we write, x proportional 1/y.</li>
    </ol><br/>
