<h1>Test Of Divisibility</h1><br/>

<p><b>1. Divisibility By 2 :</b><br/>
 A number is divisible by 2 if its unit digit is any of 0,2,4,6,8.</p><br/>
 Example. 5678 is divisible by 2, while 4567 is not divisile by 2.</p><br/>

<p><b>2. Divisibility By 3 :</b><br/>
 A number is divisible by 3 only when the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.</p><br/>
 Example 1. In the number 5655, the sum of digits = 21, which is divisible by 3, therefore 5655 is divisible by 3.<br/>
 Example 2. In the number 36754, the sum of digits = 25, which is not divisible by 3, therefore 5655 is not divisible by 3.</p><br/>

<p><b>3. Divisibility By 4 :</b><br/>
 A number is divisible by 4 if the sum of its last two digits is divisible by 4.</p><br/>
 Example 1. 6879376 is divisible by 4, since 76 is divisible by 4.<br/>
 Example 2. 496138 is not divisible by 4, since 38 is not divisible by 4.</p><br/>

<p><b>4. Divisibility By 5 :</b><br/>
 A number is divisible by 5 only when its unit digit is 0 or 5.</p><br/>
 Example. Each of the number 35645 and 56780 is divisible by 5.</p><br/>

<p><b>5. Divisibility By 8 :</b><br/>
 A number is divisible by 8 if the last 3 digits is divisible by 8 .</p><br/>
 Example 1. In the number 4892192, the number formed by last 3 digits, namely 192 is divisible by 8, therefore 4892192 is divisible by 8.<br/>
 Example 2. In the number 4567633, the number formed by last 3 digits, namely 633 is not divisible by 8, therefore 4567633 is not divisible by 8.</p><br/>

<p><b>6. Divisibility By 9 :</b><br/>
 A number is divisible by 9 only when the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.</p><br/>
 Example 1. In the number 246591, the sum of digits = 27, which is divisible by 9, therefore 246591 is divisible by 9.<br/>
 Example 2. In the number 734519, the sum of digits = 29, which is not divisible by 9, therefore 734519 is not divisible by 3.</p><br/>

<p><b>7. Divisibility By 10 :</b><br/>
 A number is divisible by 10 only when its unit digit is 0 .</p><br/>
 Example 1. 68793760 is divisible by 10, since its unit digit is 0.<br/>
 Example 2. 496138 is not divisible by 10,  since its unit digit is not 0.</p><br/>

<p><b>8. Divisibility By 11 :</b><br/>
 A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits at odd places and
the sum of its digits at even places is either 0 or a number divisible by 11.</p><br/>
 Example. In number 29435417 <br/>
(sum of its digits at odd places)-(sum of its digits at even places)<br/>
=(7+4+3+9)-(1+5+4+2)=(23-12)=11,which is divisible by 11.</p><br/>
