<h1>Prime And Composite Numbers</h1><br/>

<p><b>Prime Numbers : </b>A counting number is called a prime number if it has exactly
    two factors, namely itself and 1.<br/><br/>
    So each prime number is only divisible by itself and 1.<br/>
    1(one) can not be a prime number.<br/>
   Example. All prime numbers less than 50 are:
2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47 <br/></p>

<p><b>Composite Numbers : </b>The Nature numbers which are not prime, are called composit numbers.</p><br/>
<p><b>Co-Primes : </b>Two Nature numbers a and b are said to be co-prime if their HCF is 1.<br/>
(3,2),(7,9),(5,4) etc. are pairs of co-primes.</p>
