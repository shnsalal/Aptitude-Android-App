<h1>Chain Rule</h1><br/>
<p><b>Direct Proportion :</b> Any two quantities are said to be directly proportional,
if on the increase of one quantity, the other quantity increases and vice-versa.<br/><br/>

    Example : <br/>
    Work done is directly proportional to the number of men working on it.<br/>
    (more men  (↑), more work  (↑))</p>

<p><b>Indirect Proportion :</b>  Any two quantities are said to be indirectly proportional,
    if on the increase of one quantity, the other quantity decreases and vice-versa.<br/><br/>

    Example : <br/>
    Time taken to finish a work is inversely proportional to the number of persons on it.<br/>
    (more persons  (↑), less is the time taken to finish a work  (↓))</p>
