# Aptitude-Android-App
This is a static and simple application using Android. 
I made this application during my graduation for final year project.

The era of mobile technology opens the windows to the android app. The websites are vanishing and the mobile phones are emerging. 
It’s the time to change from conventional websites to apps, which has become the part of our daily routine. 
we are introducing “Aptitude” the android application software which would be a miniature learning App. 
Everyone can use this app but student can take more advantage from this pocket aptitude,  project gives a total solution to everyone.
